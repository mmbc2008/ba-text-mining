    "This notebook describes the LAB-2 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "* Learn how to run a rule-based sentiment analysis module (VADER)\n",
    "* Learn how to run a machine learning sentiment analysis module (Scikit-Learn/ Naive Bayes)\n",
    "* Learn how to run scikit-learn metrics for the quantitative evaluation\n",
    "* Learn how to perform and interpret a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes of the tools (in terms of Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>)\n",
    "* Learn how to evaluate the results qualitatively (by examining the data) \n",
    "* Get insight into differences between the two applied methods\n",
    "* Get insight into the effects of using linguistic preprocessing\n",
    "* Be able to describe differences between the two methods in terms of their results\n",
    "* Get insight into issues when applying these methods across different  domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are going to create your own gold standard set from 50 tweets. You will the VADER and scikit-learn classifiers to these tweets and evaluate the results by using evaluation metrics and inspecting the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* **Read the assignment (see below)**\n",
    "* **Lab3.2-Sentiment-analysis-with-VADER.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Lab3.3-Sentiment-analysis.with-scikit-learn.ipynb**\n",
    "* **Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are asked to perform both quantitative evaluations and error analyses:\n",
    "* a quantitative evaluation concerns the scores (Precision, Recall, and F<sub>1</sub>) provided by scikit's classification_report. It includes the scores per category, as well as micro and macro averages. Discuss whether the scores are balanced or not between the different categories (positive, negative, neutral) and between precision and recall. Discuss the shortcomings (if any) of the classifier based on these scores\n",
    "* an error analysis regarding the misclassifications of the classifier. It involves going through the texts and trying to understand what has gone wrong. It servers to get insight in what could be done to improve the performance of the classifier. Do you observe patterns in misclassifications?  Discuss why these errors are made and propose ways to solve them."

    "#### Answer\n",
    "* Sentence 1: The sentence \"I love apples\", is mostly classified as positive (0.808), this is to be expected and due to the positive sentiment rating of the word love in the lexicon used by VADER.\n",
    "* Sentence 2: The sentence \"I don't love apples\" is classified as negative. This is reasonable since it's the negation of the previous sentence (the same sentence but including \"don't\")\n",
    "* Sentence 3: The sentence \"I love apples :-)\" is classified as even more positive than the first sentence. This is due to the smiley emoticon, which is also included in the lexicon with positive sentiment rating.\n",
    "* Sentence 4: \"These houses are ruins\" is classified between neutral and negative. This is also reasonable. Ruins has a negative sentiment rating but not as low as other words. According to this context, it could however make sense if the sentence was classified as more negative than it did.\n",
    "* Sentence 5: \"These houses are certainly not considered ruins\" has a similar value for the neutral and positive sentiment ratings (around .5), this is also reasonable since it's the negation of the previous sentence, that was classified between neutral and negative.\n",
    "* Sentence 6: \"He lies in the chair in the garden\". This sentence is classified as neutral, however it's also partially negative, which is not fitting but it's probably due to the word \"lies\" having several meanings, some of which are negative.\n",
    "* Sentence 7: \"This house is like any house\". This sentence is mostly neutral which makes sense. Again, here there is a word with several meanings (\"like\"), which is skewing the results making them more positive than they otherwise would be."
