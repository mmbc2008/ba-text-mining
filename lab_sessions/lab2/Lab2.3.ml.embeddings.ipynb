    "In this notebook, you are going to use word embeddings instead of the one-hot-encoding of words. Word embeddings have many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* they capture similarities across words that can be learned from massive amounts of text data without annotation\n",
    "* machine learning can easily exploit similarity because the embeddings are also represented as vectors\n",
    "* the word embedding vectors are much smaller (100 up to 500 dimensions) and more dense than one-hot-encodings, which results in more efficient and compact models that also generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, you should have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to replace the words in your training set by their embeddings\n",
    "* how to train a classifier enriched with embeddings\n",
    "* how to represent the words for any unseen text as embeddings\n",
    "* how to add embeddings to our NERC system\n",
    "* how to work with some popular data sets for NERC with which such embeddings can be combined\n",

    "## 1 Quick introduction to embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting features manually can get us a long way. In addition to lemma and part-of-speech, people have used other information: features of the previous words (on the left) or the next words (on the right), whether the current word starts with a capital, whether it is an abbreviation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent alternative way to create a 'semantic' representation of a word is by word embeddings: mapping words (or phrases) from the vocabulary to vectors of real numbers. Conceptually it involves a mathematical embedding from a space with many dimensions per word to a continuous vector space with a much lower dimension. For this reason, they are called dense representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, word embeddings were discussed in the research area of distributional semantics. The idea is to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data. The underlying notion is that \"a word is characterized by the company it keeps\" (Firth). Embeddings are however the weights in the hidden layer of a neural network that is trained to predict the contexts rather than representing the context in a vector directly."
